    <h1> Imports and Exports of bananas in South America </h1>
      <p> the map below shows the value of bananas flows between countries
      as well as the total number of flows, and number of exports. </p>
      <p> <img src="images/final banana map.png" /> </p>
      <p> I used the website linked below, Flowmapper, to create this flow map of banana shipments

        <p> Banana Imports and Exports South America

1.	Justification of Flow Map Design:
I used a blue color scheme for the regions to show the number of exports from each country with darker colors corresponding to a larger number of exports. I chose to use this symbology because it provides visual cues for which countries are the largest banana exporters. The nodes are mapping the total number of imports and exports for each country. They are represented with solid black proportional symbols. This symbology choice makes the nodes visually appealing and stand out from the regions where a single hue color scheme would be at risk of blending into the background on the lighter and darker ends of the color scale. Value of exports is the flow value. I used single pointed arrows for the symbology because I found it was the most visually appealing and straightforward to interpret for this data set. I used a solid black color scheme again to maintain contrast between the base map and flows.
2.	Interpretation of Flow Patterns:
•	Chili, Argentina, and Uruguay receive the most flows. The value of imports is highest for Chili and Argentina and these countries are receiving bananas from the most countries. Ecuador, Brazil, and Bolivia have the largest number of flows sent. They have multiple flows extending to other countries and they are of large values as well as few or no flows being received and those which are of low value.
•	Most of the flows in this map are originating in the North and being received by countries further South.
•	Countries with the most exports (dark blue) also have the largest total for exports and imports and are likely to be the source node for high value exports to other countries. The opposite can be said about countries with few exports (white) where low total exports and imports and low value of exports are seen in conjunction with one and other.
